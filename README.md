# meaning-of-ISGRI-energy-ranges


Most of all, at low energy, OSA11 assigned larger energies to counts than OSA10.2 . It is motivated physically, and also by observations of sources for which there is a relatively clear feature (e.g. Her X-1).

Analogous effect is at high energy: what OSA10.2 puts (clearly unjustly) >100 keV, OSA11.0 puts below 100 keV (filling in the hole you can see in OSA spectra).

It means, generally, that "energy ranges" (which are in fact reconstructed energy ranges, not true energy ranges, and the difference is necessarily important for a dispersive response like in ISGRI) mean different things.

Normally, we checked, that the total significance, if energy ranges are selected accordingly, is the same between two OSA. In fact, OSA11 is a bit better often, due to better treatment of pixel efficiency scatter.

Note that this difference is, of course present, not only between different OSA, but between early and late orbits in any single calibration: it is since ISGRI lost about fact 2 in gain in 18 years. You can appreciate that spectra just look different, we can not reconstruct-out grows in resolution.
